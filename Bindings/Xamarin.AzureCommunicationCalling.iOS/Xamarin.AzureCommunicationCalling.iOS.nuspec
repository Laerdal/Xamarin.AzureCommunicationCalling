    <releaseNotes>
        Features Added:
Azure Communication Services introduces the concept of a room for developers who are building structured conversations such as virtual appointments or virtual events. Learn more about rooms here. Get started using rooms by following the quick start guides.
Callkit Integration
Application will be able to configure call capabilities with CallKitOptions.
Application will be able to pass the means to reach a call recipient and the display name with CallKitRemoteInfo.
Application will be able to use reportIncomingCallToCallKit to handle notification when the app is in kill state.
Support for stopping an incoming call because it was answered in another device, or caller cancelled, etc.
Dominant Speakers
Dominant speakers is an extended feature that allows you to obtain a list of the active speakers in the call. The dominant speakers list can change dynamically according to the activity of the participants on the call.
        
        Bugs fixed:
Fix for issue when a call with a host would not end if the host leaves the call.
Fix for internal update when Call Id changes in the middle of a call.
