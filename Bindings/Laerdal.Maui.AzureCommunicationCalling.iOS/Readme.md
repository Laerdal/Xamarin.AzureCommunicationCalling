Laerdal's Maui bindings for Microsoft iOS Azure Communication Services Calling library
=======================

Microsoft does not provide Xamarin or Maui bindings for their mobile communication services. This library provides a wrapper for the iOS calling functionality.

Use it to setup and join ACS and/or Teams video/voice calls.

To manually compile and update the wrapper to the latest native ios version, read the create_bindings.sh carefully.
